# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone – SpaceX Launch Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I take the role of a data scientist working for a fictional company, Space Y, that aims to compete with SpaceX. The goal is to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land, which directly impacts the launch cost.

## Objective
- Predict first-stage landing success using machine learning.
- Estimate launch cost based on landing outcomes.
- Build dashboards and visualizations to support business decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SpaceX API
- SQL
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Git & GitHub

## Workflow
1. Data Collection (API & Web Scraping)
2. Data Wrangling & Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Machine Learning Modeling
6. Evaluation & Business Insights

## Expected Outcome
A machine learning model that predicts whether the first stage will land successfully, helping Space Y estimate launch costs and compete more effectively in the commercial space industry.
